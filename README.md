# Distribution-Network-Reconfiguration-DE-Algorithm
optimal reconfiguration of distribution system and allocation of wind DGs are combined with each other. 
The purpose is loss reduction of lines and improvement of voltage profile of buses. 
It is proposed to model uncertainty of loads and wind speed for getting closer to real condition of distribution network. 
The voltage profile of busses is smoother and real losses of lines are reduced by using the proposed algorithm for optimal reconfiguration and DG allocation in distribution network. 
The proposed algorithm and approaches are implemented in IEEE 33 bus systems and are compared with base state of the mentioned networks for validation of proposed algorithm.
